        This role operates in one of two modes:
        1) When "dropin_for" is not specified, creates a .network file in /etc/systemd/network
        using the supplied "name", and applies the configuration provided to that file.
        2) When "dropin_for" is specified, creates a .conf file in the dropin directory for the
        network specified, using the supplied "name", and applies the configuration provided to
        that file.

        Detailed descriptions of parameters and their behavior can be found in 'man systemd.network'.
