    short_description: Manages systemd-networkd bonded network devices.
    description:
      - |
        This role will create (or update) a number of items in /etc/systemd/network for
        each specified bonded device:
        1) A .netdev file for the bond device
        2) .network files for each link that is a member of the bond; files will be named
        with the bond device's name and a numeric suffix
        3) .link files for each interface that is a member of the bond; files will be named
        with the bond device's name and a numeric suffix

      - |
        On Debian and Debian-derivative systems the .link files are
        copied into the initramfs by the `update-initramfs` tool, which
        means that the system must be rebooted for changes in those
        files to take effect. In this situation the role will set a fact
        named 'systemd_networkd_link_reboot_required' and the system
        should be rebooted before any additional configuration of the
        bonded network links is attempted.

      - |
        Detailed descriptions of parameters and their behavior can be found in 'man systemd.netdev'
        and 'man systemd.link'.

      - |
        Sets fact named 'systemd_networkd_bond_changed' to either true or false to indicate whether
        any changes were made.
