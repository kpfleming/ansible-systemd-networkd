        This role will create (or update) three items in /etc/systemd/network for
        each specified tunnel:
        1) A drop-in directory for the underlying network
        2) A .netdev file for the tunnel device
        3) A .conf file in the drop-in directory connecting the tunnel device
        to the underlying network

        Detailed descriptions of parameters and their behavior can be found in 'man systemd.netdev'.
